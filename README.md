# Module 20 Challenge - React Portfolio

## Description

The objective for this assignment is to create a professional portfoliio using React. The portfolio must be deployed to Netlify.

## Link to the deployed application

[My React portfilio on Netlify](https://sc-reactportfolio-e76b9d.netlify.app/)

## Link to the repository for this project

https://github.com/SC-ltc/challenge-20-react-portfolio

## Items for further development

This was a very challenging assignment for me. I spent a lot of time just getting the page to render without any issues. In the future, I will aim to significantly improve the page layout and add to the Portfolio and Resume pages.
